# First Flutter Project

A simple Flutter application that displays a centered greeting message.

## About This Project

This is my first Flutter project! It's a basic mobile app that shows:
- "Hello World" text in bold
- My name "Emerance Umurerwa" 
- Clean white background with centered content

   ```
4. Choose your device (emulator or physical device)
5. The app will launch and display the greeting!
